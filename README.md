# totaltaxifare
Calculating total Chicago Taxi Fares for the year of 2016. 
- Introductory Python code for me to work on: 
Using data from kaggle and thus imported into this repository
- Plan on using Python for this. 


Proposed ideas: 
-Deviation from optimal fare
-Accuracy of file by comparing fare to "exact" calculated fare
